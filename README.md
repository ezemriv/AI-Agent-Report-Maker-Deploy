## ðŸ“œ Project Overview

This deploy-ready version focuses on the core functionality of the AI agent from the original **AI-Agent-Report-Maker** project. Users can input a natural language prompt (e.g., "Create a report for 2021 for client 1556"), and the agent will extract dates, process data, and generate a financial summary in PDF format.

### Key Features
- **AI-Powered Date Extraction**: Automatically identifies and extracts relevant date ranges from prompts.
- **Data Processing and Summaries**: Provides earnings, expenses, and cash flow summaries over specified periods.
- **PDF Report Generation**: Outputs user-friendly reports for easy analysis and insights.
